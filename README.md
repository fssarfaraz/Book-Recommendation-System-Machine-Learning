# Book-Recommendation-System-Machine-Learning

This notebook presents a book recommendation system designed to suggest personalized recommendations based on user preferences and book attributes. The system leverages a combination of techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, fuzzy matching, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) for recommendation generation.

The notebook uses books.csv as the dataset; this is a clean dataset sourced from Kaggle, contains book attributes taken from Goodreads.
